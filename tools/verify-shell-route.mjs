/**
 * Checks, IN A BROWSER, WITH A MOUSE, that a player can get from the daily
 * session to a meet and back without touching the URL bar.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS THE DECISIVE CHECK
 * ===========================================================================
 * The defect this piece closed was invisible to every unit test in the
 * repository, and it had to be: `MeetScreen` was correct, imported, and had
 * hundreds of green tests behind it. What did not exist was a PATH — the app
 * routed on query strings only, so meet day was reachable by typing `?meet=`
 * and by nothing else. 2128 tests passed on that tree.
 *
 * `src/shell/shellRoute.test.ts` proves the route graph says a player can get
 * there. `src/shell/shellWiring.test.ts` proves the shell calls that graph.
 * Neither renders anything: `vitest.config.ts` is `environment: node`, and a
 * sibling piece in this run demonstrated that a component whose clock was
 * frozen left all 2128 green. So the claim "a player can reach meet day" is
 * settled here, by loading the built app, FINDING the control, HIT-TESTING the
 * point a thumb would land on, PRESSING it, and reading what came up.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each one can fail:
 *
 *   1. The app opens on the daily session with no query string at all, and the
 *      way to meet day is on screen and pressable. Fails if the shell draws no
 *      control, or draws one something else covers.
 *   2. PRESSING IT REACHES MEET DAY. This is the one. Fails if the route is
 *      not wired, or is wired to something that does not render.
 *   3. The meet it reaches is PLAYED, not a screenshot: the weigh-in confirms,
 *      the openers confirm, and a walk-out begins. Fails if a frozen debug
 *      frame leaked into a player-opened meet.
 *   4. From GDD §6.5's recap the way back is on screen, pressable, and lands on
 *      the daily session. Fails if the meet is a dead end — which it was: the
 *      recap's only action was "see your card", and the card had none at all.
 *   5. From the CLOSE-OUT — the end of a session — the way to meet day is on
 *      screen. That is the "finish a session and reach a meet" path.
 *   6. NO CONTROL IS DRAWN OVER A LIVE SET, or over a walk-out, an attempt or a
 *      verdict. A pill over the mechanic is a mis-tap that costs a rep.
 *   7. All four debug query strings still resolve to the surface their capture
 *      tool expects. Breaking one breaks the run's evidence harness.
 *   8. The shell's chrome shows no Total (GDD §3.2: Total moves on meet day and
 *      no other day) and no fatigue readout (§3.4, §12.3).
 *
 * The testIDs are written out here rather than imported, on the same principle
 * as `capture-session.mjs`'s moment list: a check that reads its expectations
 * out of the module under test agrees with a broken module.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/verify-shell-route.mjs [--url URL] [--settle MS] [--out DIR]
